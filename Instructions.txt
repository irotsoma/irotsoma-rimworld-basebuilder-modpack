Unzip all files in the Archives directory to the Mods folder in your rimworld installation.

UOMTextures:  This one is a little tricky since I don't know the original source of the textures, and UOM is no longer around.  The main reasoning for this patch is to not add anything to the core mod folder and keep it pristine.  I have only published the xml def files allowing this to be a separate patch.  This means you'll need to get a copy of UOM to get these textures.  You can either copy them directly into your Core directory like you did with UOM.   Or extract this file to the mods folder, then copy the textures folder from UOM.  You'll then need to rename all of the files with _UOM before the file extension.  For example, DropPod.png becomes DropPod_UOM.png.  This is a quick fix as I'm moving from UOM to a custom patch.  I'll get better textures once this modpack is a little further along.  I just really liked these textures.
